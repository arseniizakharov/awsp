  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Homebrew installed awsp but did not modify your shell startup files.
      Homebrew also did not install AWS CLI; awsp checks for `aws` at runtime.

      Enable shell integration once:
        awsp setup zsh

      For bash:
        awsp setup bash

      Then restart the shell, or enable it immediately:
        source "$HOME/.config/awsp/shell/awsp.sh"
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/awsp --version")
    assert_match "awsp shell integration", shell_output("#{bin}/awsp init zsh")
  end
end
